# This is a placeholder for the 192x192 icon
# In a real implementation, you would need to:
# 1. Take your logo.png file
# 2. Resize it to 192x192 pixels
# 3. Save it as icon-192x192.png
# 
# For now, we'll use the existing logo.png
# You can create this file using an image editor or online tool
